  <h1>About webmention.app</h1>
  <p><a href="https://remysharp.com">Remy Sharp</a> wrote webmention.app because it seemed like webmention notification
    systems were thin on the ground, and wanted to use a notification system that was agnostic of the user software.</p>
  <p>The service is currently free, and will remain so, as it is able to run on a single server with little to zero
    maintenance.</p>
